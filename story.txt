<p> the light from the fire spills <br> from the windows, out into <br> the dark. </p>
<p> the room is cold. </p>
<p> a ragged stranger <br> stumbles through the door <br> and collapses at the corner. </p>
<p> the room is mild.</p>
<p> the wind howls outside.</p>
<p> the wood is running out.</p>
<p>the room is warm.</p>
<p>the stranger shivers, <br> and mumbles quietly, <br> her words are unintelligible.</p>
<p>the stranger in the corner <br> stops shivering. <br> <br> her breathing calms.</p>
<p>the sky is grey and the <br> wind blows relentlessly.</p>
<p> the stranger is standing <br> by the fire. <br> she says she can help. <br> says she can teach things.</p>
<p> teacher says she can help you <br> make a cart for carrying wood.</p>
<p>teacher says she can make <br> books to spread knowledge.</p>

<p>the fire is dead.</p>
<p> the room is cold.</p>
